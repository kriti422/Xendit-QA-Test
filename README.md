# Thank You
Thank you for giving me this opportunity for implementing this test. I thoroughly enjoyed implementing and making the testcases. It helped me in improving my learning concepts as well.

I have Automated one of the test scenarios which is in the 'features' folder. But since the online calculator functionality is built over canvas. It was much of a challenging task to get the value and assert.

I will require some UI Validation tools like Applitools Eye. Initially I tried and ended up spending alot of time on that, hence ran out of time. I have written the test cases inside the "other_features" folder but automating them is left due to overspending time on looking at the UI functionality.

Since being new to this functionality, I am trying to implement as possibly i can and would require more time to implement.I have written manual test cases for four Calculator Functionalities under `other_features` file

Request you to please check the test cases written inside the folder `other_features` which are not automated yet.I have made the Project running with one automated test case scenario mentioned in "calculator.feature" file along with the working screenshot functionality. I am continously learning more regarding new tools to implement these functionality with ease.

Looking forward to learn and implement more with Xendit.
